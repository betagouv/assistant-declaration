## Architecture

### Stack

_(When appropriate we describe the motivation of the choice)_

- Node.js
- TypeScript (used for both the frontend and the backend to mutualise utils and to simplify the stack)
- React (client-side)
- Responsive integration of the frontend
- RDBMS database (PostgreSQL to benefit from custom objects, to store files, and to manage the job queues)
- Next.js (framework to manage both the client and server)
- Prisma (database ORM to get typings dealing with requests)
- tRPC (used for client-server communication) (it's like GraphQL but "natively" using TypeScript schemas)
- npm (package manager)
- GitHub
- GitHub Actions (for the CI/CD)
- Scalingo (serverless provider, no Kubernetes or whatever)
- DSFR + MUI (UI frameworks)
- Storybook through Chromatic (helps collaborating with the non-technical team members and also bring more chance to have our components reused among the community) (also performs visual testing)
- Figma (to design any part of the project and collaborate)
- Jest (unit tests)
- axe-core (integrated within Storybook to perform accessibility testing)
- Buildpack (the final application bundle)
- Sentry (detection and reporting of errors)
- Scaleway (used to send emails)
- Brevo (used as a fallback of Scaleway to send emails)
- Crisp (for customer support but only loaded if the user explicitly triggers a button)

**Note we list all flows known in advance except the last wildcard entry. This is because `Assistant déclaration` does gather ticketing data from dynamic inputs. We cannot list them all since there are dynamic, but those endpoints are just for read-only purposes and no user data is sent to their servers except to authenticate the call.**

### Database structure diagram

We do not commit the database structure directly since some initialization can be done by our librairies (ORM, queueing system...).

To get a meaningful overview we advise you to:

1. Follow usage instructions within the `README.md` to launch the application locally
2. Download and launch the database tool `DBeaver` that is open source
3. Configure it by using connection information from the `/.env.test`
4. In the menu, under your connection open `Databases > xxxx > Schemas`
5. On each schema (`public` and `pgboss` currently), right click and select `View diagram`

Those are interactive entity relationship diagrams representing the entire database.

## Requirements

**The following is about the production environment. We would not expand on a development environment because it would store fake data, and would give a bit more priviliges to developers to test and debug, but still, it would totally be isolated from the production.**

### Server access and communication security

Since the provider Scalingo does not allow assigning specific roles to collaborators, it means someone having the access has full access.

Considering this we chose:

- to give all developers an access in the development environment
- to give only the main developer an access in the production environment

All team members are required to use the 2FA in Scalingo and to use a secure password manager to generate have credentials not guessable.

### Application authentication and access control

The access to the protected application dashboard is only done through authentication.

There are 2 kinds of users:

- **Admins**: ability to have an overview of entrepreneurs data
- **Entrepreneurs**: no ability to manage access

All are required to have a password matching at least some complexity.

Some warnings about security are done during the onboarding and they have a support section available on the platform even if not authenticated.

### Activity tracking

- Errors are forwarded to Sentry so we can debug and manage alerts
- Our logs give an overview of what is happening

In both cases no sensitive information is provided.

### Application update policy

We chose to not use an automated tool to upgrade our dependencies because:

- Most of the time new versions are not about security, so automation is likely to bring breaking changes in our own application since it's known a few respects the `semver` naming when publishing a new version
- When it's about a security reason, it's in majority targeting a deep nested dependency and the indirect usage we have of it is far from the vulnerability

Instead we rely on CVE notifications from GitHub and we decide if it is a trigger. And we also keep looking at notifications from our organization since a lot of projects share the same stack.

### Integrity

Scalingo enables automatic backups and its own security guards.

We plan in the future to duplicate those backups onto another provider in a different location to be sure having our Scalingo access compromised will not be a dead-end.

### Privacy
